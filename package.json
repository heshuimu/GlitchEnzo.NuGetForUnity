	"description": "NuGetForUnity is a NuGet client built from scratch to run inside the Unity Editor. NuGet is a package management system which makes it easy to create packages that are distributed on a server and consumed by users. NuGet supports sematic versioning for packages as well as dependencies on other packages. This is a restructure that confronts to the standard Unity Package Manager standard. I (the owner of this repo) would also push fixes found in my own use cases. ",
